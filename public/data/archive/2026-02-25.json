The Shanghai Gold Exchange announced it will lower margin rates, while U.S. gold futures for April delivery fell 0.6% to $5,191.50. Silver also pulled back 0.98% to $88.04 from Monday's $88.91. Despite the intraday pullback, the underlying structural bid remains intact — tariff uncertainty, central bank demand, and Iran tensions continue to support the metals complex.",

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index collapsed to 5/100 — a reading only seen three times since 2018 (Aug 2019, June 2022, and earlier this month). Over $468M in leveraged positions were liquidated in 24 hours. BTC spot ETFs have bled $3.8 billion across five consecutive weeks, the longest outflow streak since February 2025. BTC now trades ~50% below its ATH above $126,000.",

The dueling signals suggest markets expect a last-ditch diplomatic effort before potential escalation. Meanwhile, Polymarket traders see only a 17% chance BTC hits $75K in February but a 31% chance it drops to $60K, reflecting deep bearish positioning.",
